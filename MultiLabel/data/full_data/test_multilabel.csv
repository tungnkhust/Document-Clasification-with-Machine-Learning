 treasury s baker under fire for wall street drop author by alver carlson author washington oct as official washington sought to restore investor confidence after monday s wall street collapse treasury secretary james baker came under fire from critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis baker s weekend blast at the west german bundesbank for boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an international accord to stabilize currency values nigel lawson british chancellor of the exchequer was among those who said the treasury secretary s statements helped spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors think that a clash between the two major economic powers would damage the world economy lawson told a london television interviewer tuesday i think the scale of the stock fall was very great that i think was partly due to statements that have been made by senior figures on the other side of the atlantic it was a dispute that should never have happened he added although baker appeared to patch over the rift at a hastily called meeting with west german officials monday he still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the united states on tuesday baker cut short a long planned trip to scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis said one us analyst of baker s weekend remarks his timing could not have been worse one government bond salesman in new york said he actually thought that yelling at the germans and threatening to smack the dollar down would work that doesn t show much understanding of international monetary gamesmanship however some analysts said west germany s stubborn march toward higher interest rates may have forced baker s hand on the surface baker may look responsible for this but if you go back to see what caused it unsettling of financial markets it was west german policy said robert brusca of nikko securities international in new york all mr baker did was to mention the obvious in public so making him responsible for it was a little like killing the messenger he said after monday s talks the us and west german governments made it clear that the louvre currency accord pieced together in paris in february was still in effect wall street feared that collapse of the agreement might be a prelude to hyper inflation and economic malaise similar to the late s analysts believe monday s wall street crash wiped out about billion dlrs in stock values treasury sources said that baker already unhappy about bonn s refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the global recovery moving was angered by a bundesbank interest rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite he felt that the us recovery inching along in its th month could no longer be the only engine of global economic expansion a growing us economy has been serving as a huge market for debtor country exports moreover baker the consummate politician was worried that the republican party might face next year s presidential election with its main showpiece a vibrant economy badly tarnished a rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt crisis and completely choke off us economic growth that has already slowed to a tepid pct annual rate there s no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the economy and it s important that the psychology turn around quickly or else obviously the panic will feed on itself and eventually there ll be a serious price to pay economically former deputy treasury secretary richard darman said in a television interview in many ways the official response was mild washington was stunned by the sudden wall street retreat with president reagan speaking for most people by admitting that he was puzzled us government sources said the secretary immediately returned to the treasury to be briefed on market developments and presumably their political impact for all of this it seems unlikely that baker s status in washington will diminish because of the market fall asked by reporters if somebody s head should roll because of the wall street retreat texas democratic senator lloyd bentsen said with some irony oh i think it s much too late to be doing thatyou have an administration that s taken the attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and retire to the living room to take a nap you just can t do that ,interest

 tokyo stock plunge could force easier money policy author by rich miller author tokyo oct plunging tokyo stock prices will prevent the bank of japan from raising its discount rate and could even force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues government and private economists said a rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major deflationary impact on the real economy they said although bank of japan officials have consistently maintained that they had no plans to raise the pct discount rate many in the markets have thought otherwise fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the central bank s apparent decision last week to countenance higher rates on commercial bills dealers said but today s stock market collapse prices fell nearly pct means that the bank of japan would be hard pressed to raise the discount rate now despite its concerns about a renewed outbreak of inflation dealers and economists said japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the markets concluded that the stock market s collapse precluded the central bank from carrying out the widely rumoured discount rate increase a senior government economist suggested that both the us and japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a further drop in new york and tokyo stock prices they need to support the stock and security markets he said but bank of japan officials said they saw no need to change policy for the moment although one admitted that the central bank may have to rethink its strategy if tokyo stock prices continue to plunge during the rest of the week both government and bank of japan economists agreed the economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago with the economy recovering strongly the steep drop in stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and business confidence one government economist said there will be some impact on the real economy but it won t be that big said another individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their own although they do participate through trust funds and other investment vehicles and while many manufacturing firms turned to financial market investments for profits during last year s economic downturn the recent rebound has allowed them to refocus their attention on their core businesses he said paradoxically it is the pick up in the economy that is partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have shifted funds away from financial investments to increase inventories and step up capital spending one government economist said in deciding what response to make to the steep stock price drop the bank of japan must first determine whether prices will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation one central bank official said that will at least take a couple of days if not weeks he said ,interest

 bundesbank calls for central bank cooperation frankfurt april bundesbank board member claus koehler called on central banks of major industrialised nations to cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies in a lecture at the university of surrey pre released here koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them he said he added that west german growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to marks from above two marks at the start of koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods services and investments it was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow to reverse such a rise in the money stock interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off in other words the monetary policy measures required are different from and sometimes diametrically opposed to those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity koehler said the dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive us current account deficit but attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems the sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of us imports and a sharp fall in the cost of european imports but the volume effect of falling imports to the us and rising imports to europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term koehler said a reduction in the us current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of gnp was higher than domestic demand in japan and west germany by contrast domestic demand should rise faster than gnp in germany this did indeed happen in koehler said if a further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented the us current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the us but only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would europe and japan look for financial investment in the us when selecting monetary policy instruments a central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions koehler said the bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates it was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem the debt problem and the current account problem a strategy had to be designed that helped the safeguarding of non inflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions koehler said given the system of floating exchange rates it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene it sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set because they were only testing points for the market he said in order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies koehler said ,interest

 bundesbank credit policy changes unlikely author by jonathan lynn reuters author frankfurt june the bundesbank is unlikely to change credit policies when its central bank council meets on thursday for its last session before the venice summit banking economists and money market dealers said the bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts and is unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates in the near future they said the council will meet in saarbruecken and the meeting will be followed by a news conference at around gmt but bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was usually called when the council meets outside frankfurt and did not necessarily herald any policy moves bundesbank vice president helmut schlesinger said today there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply growth had shown no signs of slowing in may and the dollar was stable against the mark schlesinger told reuters in tokyo where the bundesbank has opened a representative office that the west german economy was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted to one pct in the first quarter money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in a pct range for most of this month after the bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a minimum bid rate of pct allocating funds at pct they have set this signal and indicated they could maybe lower market rates even further but not with the discount or lombard winfried hutmann chief economist of schroeder munchmeyer hengst investment gmbh said werner chrobok managing partner at bethmann bank said german rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and around historical lows for west germany a further cut in rates would have little impact on the economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand with companies swimming in liquidity chrobok said the bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move on interest rates when this would be better held in reserve the bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder he said a cut in the discount or lombard rates to bring them in line with the new structure of money market rates since last month would have little practical significance dealers said the bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a diplomatic gesture before next week s venice summit but bundesbank president karl otto poehl has often made it clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere eyewash economists said it was really up to the bonn government to cut taxes rather than for the bundesbank to ease monetary policy to meet pressure on west germany at the venice summit but with bonn struggling to finance already announced tax cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget deficit it is hard to see how bonn could cut taxes further the bonn government will be in a very weak position in venice because they can t risk increasing the deficit further said schroeder muenchmeyer hengst s hutmann bethmann s chrobok said if anything is to happen before venice it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy but i don t expect any convincing measures he said money market dealers noted that call money continued to normalize today falling to pct from yesterday and as much as five pct on friday when it was pushed up by month end distortions call money could come under upwards pressure later this month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on behalf of customers starting in the week beginning june two public holidays that week could also distort the market dealers said they expected the bundesbank to allocate funds tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged pct after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of pct and to fully replace the billion marks in an outgoing pact but dealers said it was possible the bundesbank would allocate funds at pct rather than that would not represent a tightening of policy however because the bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates at the minimum accepted rate some banks may try to get a full allocation by bidding heavily at pct dealers said on another issue poehl has said the bundesbank is likely to lift restrictions on private use of the european currency unit ecu at one of its meetings soon saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement on this gesture to european unity as it is the capital of the saarland bordering france and was twice under french occupation this century but dealers said an ecu announcement was unlikely to come this week as a number of technical and legal matters had still to be resolved for instance how german ecu accounts would be treated for minimum reserve purposes ,interest

 no reason to cut rates bundesbank s schlesinger author by rich miller reuters author tokyo june bundesbank vice president helmut schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now with money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in may and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark schlesinger told reuters that he was not convinced that a further cut in interest rates was needed the economy is picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted to one pct in the first quarter from the fourth he added we may have an increase in gnp starting in the second quarter he said in an interview concerned by the first quarter downturn the us has been pressing west germany to pump up its economy and boost its imports either through fiscal or monetary policy schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was mainly due to adverse weather conditions just as occured in year on year growth was thus about two pct he estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole would probably be between one and two pct it is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic demand does not grow strongly he said noting that interest rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money stock growth was slowing down from its recent year on year pace of to eight pct well above the bundesbank s three to six pct target he said the target could still be achieved but much will depend on the direction of long term capital flows heavy inflows particularly in january around the time of the ems revaluation boosted domestic money supply there is still a certain hope that the net inflow of foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit reversed schlesinger said a major reason for the inflows was the market s conviction that the mark was headed higher as we can see from the market expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have diminished schlesinger said the recent widening of interest rate differentials the fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined towards stabilizing the dollar he said asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar rise as the us did in march when the dollar rose above marks he said this would depend on the circumstances at midday here the dollar stood at marks central banks are always in contact about these fluctuations but i cannot give any answer how they would react schelsinger said one has to look at how it the market is moving he said adding it is not only our own case it is also the american case he said that the west german export industry has been hit hard by the dollar s sharp fall and would probably like to see some correction now but it wouldn t be good to have short term fluctuations he said let us wait and see it is mainly the strength of the dollar fall in a very short period which was a little bit of a shock than the level of rates as such schlesinger said the sharp rise of the mark coupled with weak prices of such key commodities as oil had a favourable impact on west german inflation down year although there have recently been signs of inflation picking up he said that this was due to changes in key commodity prices the underlying inflation rate this year would be unchanged at about one to pct he said schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth was longer term in that the economy was building up the potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation the above target growth of money supply over the past months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of targets themselves a matter which might be taken up at the mid year meeting of the bundesbank s council schlesigner said but he added i don t see any great pressure to go away from it ,interest

 uptrend remains intact for debt futures author by patricia campbell reuters author chicago june the six basis point rise of the past month in us debt futures may be extended next week by a series of us economic reports analysts said as long as the dollar holds firm interest rates have declined by approximately basis points over the last month largely over indications that inflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing us trade balance in nominal terms samuel kahan chief financial economist with kleinwort benson government securities said kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in the economy during the first quarter but his concern is whether the us economy will sustain that strength in the longer term weak us economic growth could hurt the dollar which has become more important to the direction of debt futures than the beneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy the median trade expectations for tuesday s us consumer price index and durable goods reports are up pct and down pct respectively meanwhile the eight billion dlr drop in the m money supply announced this week was surprising much larger than expected according to kahan unless quickly reversed such a trend will ensure that june m growth will be negative kahan said taken in conjunction with m and m aggregates which kahan said have slowed to a crawl below federal reserve board annual targets the consequences could be a hint of economic weakness down the road he said based on chart formations t bond futures may be poised for further gains although the advance has been slowed recently analysts said september t bonds are up almost six points since about may merrill lynch debt analyst jim duggan noted september bond futures climbed from the low of a month ago to over in mid june duggan said while follow through buying has aided the advance so far and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through chart support the rally in september t bonds has been thwarted above the level the level is formidable resistance and must be taken out before this activity is anything other than a trading range market carroll mcentee and mcginley futures debt analyst brian singer said the dollar remains the key fundamental factor and the us currency has made little headway of late analysts said the critical variable remaining in the market is the value of the dollar kahan said additional influences next week will be possible developments ahead of an opec members meeting and the impact and size of the us budget deficit although these will not be in the forefront of the market early next week kahan said in looking ahead to the us treasury mini refunding auctions of billion in t notes on tuesday wednesday and thursday singer said the market will likely greet the results with little excitement however a successful auction could prove to be a turning point depending on prevailing market psychology ,interest
 uk lenders offer more fixed rate mortgages author by norma cohen reuters author london june more uk lenders are offering homebuyers fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other interest rates and with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in years the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers trying to lock into cheap money the decision to offer fixed rate loans industry officials said reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home mortgage business while fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the uk they were the mainstay of the business in the us up until only a few years ago but in the early s interest rates soared us lenders mostly savings and loan associations were earning rates as low as three pct on year fixed rate mortgages they held in their portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as pct to induce them to retain their accounts as a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were forced to merge the survivors decided to offer mortgages whose rates would move in line with the cost of funds we very much have the example of the us thrifts in mind said a spokesman for abbey national building society explaining why his institution for the time being is only offering variable rate mortgages the rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders concede they are being forced to undercut each other still more sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier this week by the nation s two largest building societies and by national westminster bank plc reflect growing competition for new business officials at all three institutions said the fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even below those on the variable rate loans of course they are less profitable than other variable rate mortgages said a spokesman for midland bank plc which earlier this year said it earmarked mln dlrs for fixed rate new mortgage loans but he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable loans because it was just another way to attract people to our mortgage product trustee savings bank plc tsb was offering five year fixed rate mortgages at pct earlier this year the mln stg that tsb set aside for the loans was exhausted within just a few days according to a spokeswoman everybody loves an under pct mortgage she said noting that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of pct of its volume in short the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest rates if interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the lender is earning an above average return on assets but if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won the benefit of cheap money household mortgage co had planned to offer a year fixed rate mortgage after the june elections on the assumption that a conservative party victory would help money market rates fall further according to duncan young managing director young explained that the company had planned to protect itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a complicated hedging instrument but money market rates have risen contrary to expectations and the company has shelved its plans for the time being he said money market rates were too high to arrange both the mortgages and hedge profitably however he said that when the household mortgage co does make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them this means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond and selling them to an investor for technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate mortgages in the us where fixed rate mortgages are popular again securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money over the past few years ,interest

 energy us petrochemical industry author by julie vorman reuters author houston april cheap oil feedstocks the weakened us dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching pct will propel the streamlined us petrochemical industry to record profits this year with growth expected through at least major company executives predicted this bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted gaf corp gaf privately held cain chemical inc and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants oil companies such as ashland oil inc ash the kentucky based oil refiner and marketer are also shopping for money making petrochemical businesses to buy i see us poised at the threshold of a golden period said paul oreffice chairman of giant dow chemical co dow adding there s no major plant capacity being added around the world now the whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones analysts say the chemical industry s biggest customers automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics are expected to buy quantities this year us petrochemical plants are currently operating at about pct capacity reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by to pct this year said john dosher managing director of pace consultants inc of houston demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as pct he said oreffice speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in houston said dow would easily top the mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history in when oil prices were still above dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong us dollar dow had profits of mln dlrs i believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it oreffice said gaf chairman samuel heyman estimated that the us chemical industry would report a pct gain in profits during last year the domestic industry earned a total of billion dlrs a pct leap from the turn in the fortunes of the once sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning said pace s john dosher dosher said last year s fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the american dollar was weakening against foreign currencies that helped boost us chemical exports also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by middle eastern oil producers in the early s finally virtually all major us chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses the restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts gaf which made an unsuccessful attempt in to acquire union carbide corp uk recently offered three billion dlrs for borg warner corp bor a chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals another industry powerhouse wr grace gra has divested its retailing restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions but some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities such as ethylene in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom designed for a small group of buyers companies like dupont dd and monsanto co mtc spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated dosher said but i think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market some top chemical executives share the concern the challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes gaf s heyman cautioned the shift from commodity chemicals may be ill advised specialty businesses do not stay special long houston based cain chemical created this month by the sterling investment banking group believes it can generate mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend chairman gordon cain who previously led a leveraged buyout of dupont s conoco inc s chemical business has spent billion dlrs since january to buy seven petrochemical plants along the texas gulf coast the plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products this kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous high margin business cain said adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually garo armen an analyst with dean witter reynolds said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum wood and steel products armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years provided the us economy continues its modest rate of growth ,earn

 deficit cuts seen unable to cure trade deficit author by irwin arieff author washington april financial analysts say they are pleased with congressional moves to trim next year s federal budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help improve the us trade deficit or buoy the economy the house of representatives is expected to vote tomorrow to approve a trillion dollar budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year that reduces the deficit by billion dlrs similarly the senate budget committee has approved a plan that would cut federal red ink by about billion dlrs next year in terms of the economy billion dlrs is infinitesimal so cuts of this magnitude will have little impact on the economy and the trade deficit said stanley collander a touche ross federal budget policy analyst at best it will have a small positive effect collander said in an interview federal reserve board chairman paul volcker has repeatedly told congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar the us government has attempted to remedy the trade imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar but volcker has warned that a further fall in the dollar s value is fraught with danger such a decline he has said could refuel inflation as imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit in addition in february us officials meeting with other major industrialized nations in paris agreed that the value of the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates should be stabilized at around current levels as part of that agreement japan and west germany agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies and the united states agreed to cut its budget deficit the alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a way to deal with the trade deficit volcker said recently is to reduce us consumption particularly federal spending if you don t deal with the budget deficit everything else you do is going to be counterproductive volcker said in recent testimony before the senate banking committee volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the government s purse strings than have the fed tighten the credit supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the united states analysts say that fed tightening now could choke off the current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession kemper financial services economist john silvia stressed that any deficit reduction was better than none but he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to give the federal reserve board the flexibility it needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar from plunging further in world exchange markets there s no doubt that some deficit reduction helps but if your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the fed s flexibility to conduct monetary policy then the answer is it s not enough silvia told reuters the us trade deficit has become one of the government s most vexing and persistent problems the deficit was billion dlrs and there is as yet little indication that this year s figure will be any lower though administration officials have predicted it will drop by about to billion dlrs by year s end in the past volcker has joked that he never lost sleep worrying whether congress would cut too much fat from the federal budget on the other hand he also has made it clear he is not attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for the period by last year s gramm rudman balanced budget law while the new law set a ceiling of billion dlrs for next year s federal deficit both the house and senate budget committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall short of the deficit reduction goal by about billion dlrs for political reasons to billion dlrs is about the most you re going to get out of congress at the present time said touche ross s collander to do something more than that would be extraordinary remarkable and very very difficult collander said the real danger for congress was to end up short of the deficit reduction goal set by its budget panels to an extent this has become the minimum acceptable reduction level he explained anything less than that will now look like a failure to wall street the budget plan now under debate on the house floor would lower an estimated billion dlr deficit for the year beginning on october one to about billion dlrs by cutting defense and domestic programs by billion dlrs from their anticipated spending levels for next year the senate budget committee has called for a deficit of nearly billion dlrs with about billion dlrs in new taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts ,trade

 new leader coming to us sec in challenging era author by irwin arieff reuters author washington june president reagan s nominee as top policeman for the nation s securities markets will inherit an agency challenged by an insider trading scandal wild stock price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the globalization of financial markets david ruder a year old republican law professor at northwestern university in evanston ill was named thursday to be the rd chairman of the five member us securities and exchange commission if confirmed by the senate as expected he will succeed john shad who left the agency earlier this week after a record six years as chairman to become ambassador to the netherlands the sec has been in the limelight for the past year as its investigators have probed into the most colossal insider trading scandal ever uncovered on wall street the investigation which is still active mushroomed in recent months as a growing number of well known traders and prominent investment banking firms have been charged with wrongdoing the pace of the probe picked up markedly in november after ivan boesky one of wall street s most successful stock speculators agreed to cooperate with government investigators and to pay a record mln dlrs in penalties and illegal profits after being charged with insider trading but the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices spurred by computer driven trading strategies that span markets in securities options and futures the price gyrations have combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented volatility to some us securities markets at the same time the sec is being pressed by some lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers steadily reshapes the us corporate landscape and the agency is being pushed by us and foreign exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork for an international securities marketplace in which trading occurs across borders throughout the world around the clock such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment opportunities but could strain the sec s ability to enforce us securities laws and guard investors from fraud under the leadership of shad the sec eased financial disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies eliminated many minor investor protection rules attempted to spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency s review of hostile corporate takeovers shad who had been vice chairman of the e f hutton investment banking firm brought a wall street perspective to the agency upon being named chairman in in line with the views of other top administration officials he favored marketplace determination of takeover battles over new federal regulations the sec under shad also stressed prosecution of insider trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that topped the agency s enforcement agenda during the administration of president jimmy carter a democrat securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with ruder say the new chairman designate is unlikely to significantly alter the commission s current priorities the sec currently has about employees most of them lawyers and an annual budget of about mln dlrs though that figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff the agency is one of the few in the government that actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past few years because of fees it charges public companies investment banks and other securities firms it regulates the sec is structured as an independent regulatory agency meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the president to fixed five year terms and protected from firing for policy differences alone by law no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party and the agency prepares its own budget request each year instead of leaving this to the white house established by congress in the sec traces its origins to the great stock market crash of which was attributed in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted market manipulations by large investment firms the agency requires public companies and investment vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on their financial condition and to disclose changes in their condition any time they issue new securities it requires brokers dealers and investment banks to register with it and comply with investor protection rules and it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices its first chairman was joseph kennedy an industrial magnate who was also the father of john kennedy later to become the nation s th president other former chairmen include william douglas who served from until his appointment to the us supreme court in and william casey

 german financial policy makers in rare dissension author by jonathan lynn author frankfurt oct karl otto poehl head of west germany s central bank and finance minister gerhard stoltenberg are normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the central bank s independence but a rare public row between the ebullient poehl president of the bundesbank and stoltenberg over a controversial investment tax proposal has added to the woes of the country s already nervous financial markets bankers said poehl told an investment symposium in frankfurt last thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and interest rates stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting poehl s criticism saying west germany would remain an attractive place for foreign investors the obvious lack of coordination between the bundesbank and finance ministry does not instil confidence in foreign investors said one economist for a london broker who asked not to be identified bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial policy makers would quickly patch up their relationship to steer the economy through a particularly difficult time there are plenty of objective pressures which will result in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill feeling said commerzbank ag chief economist juergen pfister news on october that the government was planning a pct withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and abroad bankers said the bundesbank was angered by the way the finance ministry announced the plan without consulting the bundesbank adequately and allowing apparently conflicting details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market both poehl and stoltenberg have been under extraordinary pressures lately poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his deputy helmut schlesinger jacking up interest rates to fight inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had pursued so far this year to promote currency stability in recent statements poehl has sounded more like schlesinger for years the softly spoken economist has been warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply growth would eventually lead to rising prices schlesinger now has a majority of support in the bundesbank council and since late summer poehl has had to represent his views bankers said poehl is in a minority in his own house said commerzbank s pfister poehl is in a dilemma he must follow a policy that is not entirely his own said another economist the dilemma is that if german interest rates rise too far they will attract funds into the country pushing up the mark and hurting west german exporters the dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the bundesbank s new tack became clear in early october since last thursday united states treasury secretary james baker has criticized the bundesbank rate increases bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the war of words between the us and west germany in which us officials talked down the dollar to force west germany to stimulate its economy and thus suck in more us exports one way west germany agreed to do this was making a round of tax cuts worth billion marks from but financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for stoltenberg than he had bargained for the cool unflappable northerner who was regularly voted most popular government politician last year had to face resistance from local barons in the government coalition parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts the withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising billion marks but it has caused an outcry among bankers who say it will push up borrowing costs the extra amount this costs the government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in meanwhile stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row which has turned into the country s worst political scandal stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in washington last month early to sort out a row in the northern state of schleswig holstein where he heads the ruling cdu party the state s cdu premier uwe barschel had to resign after allegations of a dirty tricks election campaign led to heavy losses for the cdu in state elections barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in geneva last weekend police say the death appears to have been suicide cooperation between poehl and stoltenberg is all the more remarkable as poehl is in the opposition social democrats and was appointed by former chancellor helmut schmidt when poehl s contract came up for renewal earlier this year chancellor helmut kohl s cdu led coalition government gave poehl another eight year term werner chrobok managing partner at bethmann bank said he hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again but when poehl criticized stoltenberg s tax plans he was not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the bundesbank s independence of government chrobok said ,money-fx
 bundesbank calls for central bank cooperation frankfurt april bundesbank board member claus koehler called on central banks of major industrialised nations to cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies in a lecture at the university of surrey pre released here koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them he said he added that west german growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to marks from above two marks at the start of koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods services and investments it was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow to reverse such a rise in the money stock interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off in other words the monetary policy measures required are different from and sometimes diametrically opposed to those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity koehler said the dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive us current account deficit but attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems the sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of us imports and a sharp fall in the cost of european imports but the volume effect of falling imports to the us and rising imports to europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term koehler said a reduction in the us current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of gnp was higher than domestic demand in japan and west germany by contrast domestic demand should rise faster than gnp in germany this did indeed happen in koehler said if a further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented the us current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the us but only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would europe and japan look for financial investment in the us when selecting monetary policy instruments a central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions koehler said the bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates it was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem the debt problem and the current account problem a strategy had to be designed that helped the safeguarding of non inflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions koehler said given the system of floating exchange rates it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene it sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set because they were only testing points for the market he said in order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies koehler said ,money-fx

 poehl warns against further dollar fall washington april bundesbank president karl otto poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained west german economic growth in a speech to the institute of contempory german affairs here poehl said it would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit he said the united states could face a vicious circle of depreciation inflation and more depreciation if it took that route poehl noted west germany had already taken steps to meet us demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy accelerating tax cuts cutting interest rates and tolerating above target money supply growth he said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for january to the beginning of this year but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the west german parliament but there were also limits to the impact west germany could accept on exports from a rising mark he said poehl said west germany relied on exports for about one third of its gross national product so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home a further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth he said poehl said the bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade had given some extra leeway but poehl said west germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy the underlying rate of inflation was now two pct not the reported negative inflation rates last year and west germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments for the time being we will have to focus our policy more on the external side and we can live with a more expansionary money supply but we must be very careful he said he said he shared some of the us concern about japan s trade surpluses which affected european countries as well as the united states poehl welcomed the so called louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries saying the importance of the february agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated all partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level and that further changes would damage growth he said this was a remarkable change in attitude especially on the part of our american colleagues he said but he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollar s value could overshoot ,money-fx

 bundesbank credit policy changes unlikely author by jonathan lynn reuters author frankfurt june the bundesbank is unlikely to change credit policies when its central bank council meets on thursday for its last session before the venice summit banking economists and money market dealers said the bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts and is unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates in the near future they said the council will meet in saarbruecken and the meeting will be followed by a news conference at around gmt but bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was usually called when the council meets outside frankfurt and did not necessarily herald any policy moves bundesbank vice president helmut schlesinger said today there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply growth had shown no signs of slowing in may and the dollar was stable against the mark schlesinger told reuters in tokyo where the bundesbank has opened a representative office that the west german economy was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted to one pct in the first quarter money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in a pct range for most of this month after the bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a minimum bid rate of pct allocating funds at pct they have set this signal and indicated they could maybe lower market rates even further but not with the discount or lombard winfried hutmann chief economist of schroeder munchmeyer hengst investment gmbh said werner chrobok managing partner at bethmann bank said german rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and around historical lows for west germany a further cut in rates would have little impact on the economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand with companies swimming in liquidity chrobok said the bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move on interest rates when this would be better held in reserve the bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder he said a cut in the discount or lombard rates to bring them in line with the new structure of money market rates since last month would have little practical significance dealers said the bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a diplomatic gesture before next week s venice summit but bundesbank president karl otto poehl has often made it clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere eyewash economists said it was really up to the bonn government to cut taxes rather than for the bundesbank to ease monetary policy to meet pressure on west germany at the venice summit but with bonn struggling to finance already announced tax cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget deficit it is hard to see how bonn could cut taxes further the bonn government will be in a very weak position in venice because they can t risk increasing the deficit further said schroeder muenchmeyer hengst s hutmann bethmann s chrobok said if anything is to happen before venice it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy but i don t expect any convincing measures he said money market dealers noted that call money continued to normalize today falling to pct from yesterday and as much as five pct on friday when it was pushed up by month end distortions call money could come under upwards pressure later this month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on behalf of customers starting in the week beginning june two public holidays that week could also distort the market dealers said they expected the bundesbank to allocate funds tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged pct after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of pct and to fully replace the billion marks in an outgoing pact but dealers said it was possible the bundesbank would allocate funds at pct rather than that would not represent a tightening of policy however because the bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates at the minimum accepted rate some banks may try to get a full allocation by bidding heavily at pct dealers said on another issue poehl has said the bundesbank is likely to lift restrictions on private use of the european currency unit ecu at one of its meetings soon saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement on this gesture to european unity as it is the capital of the saarland bordering france and was twice under french occupation this century but dealers said an ecu announcement was unlikely to come this week as a number of technical and legal matters had still to be resolved for instance how german ecu accounts would be treated for minimum reserve purposes ,money-fx

 analysts doubt fed firmed despite borrowing rise author by martin cherrin reuters author new york april economists said that they doubt the federal reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar despite higher discount window borrowings in the latest two week statement period and very heavy borrowings wednesday data out today show net borrowings from the fed averaged mln dlrs in the two weeks to wednesday up from mln dlrs in the prior statement period wednesday borrowings were billion dlrs as federal funds averaged a high pct one could make a case that the fed is firming but it probably isn t said william sullivan of dean witter reynolds sullivan said some may assume the fed has firmed policy modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the two weeks to wednesday were nearly mln dlrs after averaging around mln dlrs over the previous two months however the dean witter economist noted that the latest two week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand often pushes up borrrowings some might argue that the fed was firming policy but it looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions late in the statement period and didn t quite make it said ward mccarthy of merrill lynch capital markets a fed spokesman told a press press conference today that the fed had no large net one day miss of two billion dlrs or more in its reserve projections in the week ended wednesday still mccarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed the fed took no market reserve management action last thursday and friday the first two days of the week it added temporary reserves indirectly on monday via two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves directly via system repurchases on tuesday and wednesday based on fed data out today economists calculated that the two day system repurchase agreements the fed arrranged on tuesday totaled around billion dlrs they put wednesday s overnight system repos at approximately billion dlrs it is quite clear that the fed is not firming policy at this time said larry leuzzi of sg warburg and co inc citing the view shared by the other two economists leuzzi said the fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak economies in the united states and abroad and add to the financial stress of developing countries and their lenders those who believe the fed tightened policy in the latest statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar tumbled said mccarthy of merrill lynch he said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new statement period began today on disappointment yesterday s washington meetings of international monetary officials failed to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid in fact currency dealers said there was nothing in wednesday s g communique to alter the prevailing view that the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade imbalance between the united states and japan the economists generally agreed that the fed is aiming for steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average fed funds rate between six and pct this is about where the rate has been since early november i m not so sure that the fed is engineering a tighter policy to help the dollar as some suspect said sullivan of dean witter if it is however he said that fed probably has just nudged up its funds rate goal to around to pct from six to pct previously ,money-fx

 economist urges more taxes to lower nz dollar wellington oct an income tax surcharge and capital gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of the nz dollar independent economist len bayliss said bayliss a former economist with the reserve bank and the bank of new zealand said a major depreciation is needed to restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by current government policies the taxes would help cut the budget deficit which in turn would lower the value of the nz dollar he said in a speech he added that the deficit for the year ending march could be much higher than the government s billion dlr forecast since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product a major tax increase was probably unavoidable bayliss said he would have preferred an increase in the pct value added goods and services tax introduced in october but that would have had a short term inflationary impact import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary impact of a currency depreciation the government had failed to bring inflation down despite lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency he added new zealand s inflation rate was pct in the year to end september against pct in the year to end june the major deficiency in the government s anti inflation policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit bayliss said the government had also failed to reduce overseas debt and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit the widespread belief that new zealand s problems are going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought is soundly based primarily because the government s macro economic policies have been unsuccessful bayliss said ,money-fx

 us markets offer glimpse of volcker nightmare author by alan wheatley reuters author new york april today s turmoil in the us financial markets with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar s wake is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that is likely to spell more turbulence ahead economists said for two years the markets had hailed the dollar s decline as the cure all for the us trade deficit interest rates fell sharply and wall street became a one way street up but that confidence is now cracking as the financial markets suddenly believe fed chairman paul volcker s often repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse volcker s been saying for a long time that a dollar freefall would be extremely dangerous now he s got it said david jones economist at aubrey g lanston and co inc the dollar fell below yen today for the first time in years as the group of seven finance ministers in washington failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances short of further depreciation of the dollar bonds suffered their biggest one day drop in months amid worries that the dollar s slide will rekindle inflation scare away foreign investors and force the fed to tighten credit the inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than dlrs to a high of dlrs an ounce while the spike in interest rates pulled the dow jones industrial average down by points to norman robertson mellon bank chief economist called the markets instability frightening he believes economic fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that once you start the ball rolling it s difficult to stop there s a stark possibility that you could get a destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates and drives us into recession the markets are in a panic stephen marris of the institute for international economics in washington has been warning for a long time that the controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of marks and yen in february could turn into a nightmare we re still more or less on track for a hard landing but the agony may be fairly drawn out marris told reuters marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this year but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it would take very little to touch off what he calls the second phase of the hard landing whereby a loss of confidence in the dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession the stock market s reaction today and its sharp drop on march shows how the loss of confidence could come about the fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with historical experience which teaches that domestic markets are not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its decline marris said he has forecast a drop to about yen marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar s latest weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling below yen the floor that the market believes was set as part of the g paris agreement in february robertson at mellon by contrast said the loss of confidence was triggered last week when washington announced plans to slap mln dlrs of tariffs on japanese electronic imports raising the specter of a debilitating trade war many economists believe that long run stability will not return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is addressed excessive consumption in the us reflected in the massive budget deficit but in the short term given the failure of the g and of central bank intervention some feel that the fed will have no choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar the only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding cut abroad at least by japan said lanston s jones marris expects the fed to act quickly to raise interest rates even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for american farmers latin american governments and others but robert giordano chief economist at goldman sachs and co scoffed at the notion it s ridiculous to think the federal reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak against just one currency this is yen strength not dollar weakness he said giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being made toward reducing the us budget deficit we re going to have one of the biggest reductions in the budget deficit relative to gnp in history this year and nobody cares he said noting that only the deficit cut in will have been greater he said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year but for now market psychology has changed so abruptly that a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out put on your helmets giordano said ,money-fx

combination of luck and planning said pace s john dosher dosher said last year s fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the american dollar was weakening against foreign currencies that helped boost us chemical exports also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity

monsanto co mtc spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated dosher said but i think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market some top chemical executives share the concern the challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past
